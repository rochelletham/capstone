JUCE Physical Model Clarinet Plugin: takes FAUST's clarinet physical model calculations and implemented into a JUCE plugin. 


## To run the plugin:
1. Download the repo
2. Open `Projucer` and compile files
3. Optional -- Plug in an external MIDI keyboard
4. Build & run the plugin! Current set up will run the `AudioPluginHost` first then the Clarinet Plugin. Make sure MIDI input configurations are correct in the `AudioPluginHost`.
